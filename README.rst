How nutritious are our Fast Food Restaurants?
------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to present you with the healthier choices between famous (well known) fast food restaurant meals. We will explore the common meals in proportions that are made available by these particular restaurants. In our exploration and analysis, we predict that we will not find many favorable conditions in our analysis. This is partly due to varying health conditions in individuals, all the conclusions in the process should be taken with a grain of salt in this regard. Fast food is not a healthy choice. But what we will hope to have determined by the end of the analysis is the difference between the foods that can cause more 
detrimental effects on an individual’s health, than others, which may be less harmful and therefore safer 
to consume.


Process
-------

During this process we have acquired some data from the following link:

Link: http://www.acaloriecounter.com/fast-food.php

10 tables which we will use in various forms, each particular and joined in a series of analysis.
